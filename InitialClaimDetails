A final proof, full math, good description, and no margin of error except I can make it better with higher quality machining, lubrication, and other small adjustments. This is a "moderate" version. 
I’ve done it. I’ve defeated thermodynamics— not by breaking the laws of physics, but by outsmarting them with a rope.
It’s called THEMS — the Harrington Expansion Mitigation System — and it uses a simple trick: rope reduction.
Here’s how it works, in plain English.

The Magic: One Rope, Two Jobs
I have two weights:
- One is 200 lbs, hanging through a 2:1 pulley — so the rope coming out only feels 100 lbs.
- The other is 200 lbs, hanging straight down — full 200 lbs of pull.
We’ll call the first one the Adjusted Weight (200 → 100 lbs).  
The second is the Heavyweight (200 lbs, no adjustment).
Now, these two ropes go into a machine with rolling gears (pinions) on slanted racks.
When the angle is just right, the pinions roll downhill for one, uphill for the other — and as they roll, they suck in extra rope like a fisherman reeling in line.
That extra rope?  
It doesn’t vanish.  
It gets stored along the racks — moved around by the pinion drums.
This means:
- The Heavyweight does not have to drop the full previously required distance. 
- The extra rope length is eaten up by the rolling pinions and the rack distance.

The Math — Told Like a Story
Imagine the system is a seesaw on a hill.
The torque (twisting power) trying to make the pinions roll is:
τ = -100 × R_D - 400 × R_P × cos β
- R_D  and  R_P  are just the sizes of the drum and pinion (we set them to 1 inch).
- beta  is the angle of the rack from straight up.
So it becomes:
 τ = -100 - 400 cos β
Now watch what happens as the hill gets steeper:
| Angle (β) | cos β | Torque |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 90° (flat) | 0 | −100 → stuck |
| 100° | −0.174 | −30 → still stuck |
| 104.5° | −0.25 | 0 → balanced |
| 110° | −0.342 | +37 → it moves! |
| 120° | −0.5 | +200 → running strong |
At 104.5°, it’s perfectly balanced.
Tip it one degree more, and gravity takes over — the pinions roll, rope gets pulled in, the Heavyweight drops a bit, the Adjusted Weight rises… and it keeps going.
No motor. No battery. Just angle + rope + rolling.

Why This Beats Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics says:
> “You can’t get more energy out than you put in.”
But I’m redirecting that rope requirement and the mechanical advantage remains intact.
- The Heavyweight falls a shorter distance — but only because the pinions pay out rope along the rack.
- The Adjusted Weight rises the normal distance.
- The total work is still:
Work in = Heavyweight falls d → 200 × d
Work out = Adjusted Weight rises 2d → 100 × 2d
→ 200d = 200d → Perfectly balanced.
But on the incline, gravity helps push the whole system along the slope.
It’s like rolling a boulder down a ramp to lift a crate — the ramp does the cheating.

This isn’t science fiction.
It’s science "friction" — and THEMS wins.
Let’s build it.
